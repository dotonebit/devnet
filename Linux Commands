Using the Bash (the Bourne Again Shell)
=======================================

touch: to create an empty file
mkdir: make a new directory
mkdir -p: make all required sub-directories in the path
rm: remove a file
rm -r: remove an entire directory and its contents
rmdir: remove an empty directory
rm -rf: remove a directory and contents including write-protected files
cp: copy a file
mv: move or rename a file
sudo: run a command as root user
su: change to the root user


File Permissions
================

Permissions are based on two factors:
- permissions assigned to a specific user and group (owner/user, group, other)
- permissions assigned to a specific action (read, write, execute)

- = file
d = directory
rwx = read, write, execute

Code structure: file/directory (1) - user (3) - group (3) - other (3)

Example: drwxrwxrwx is a directory, where user, group and other have read, write and execute permissions

Example: -rw-rw-r-- is a file, where user and group have read and write permissions, other can only read

chmod: update and change file permissions

chmod [u, g, o] (+/- [r, w, x]) for each action

Example: chmod u+x script.py says that the user of the file should be able to eXecute the script

Every Bash shell script starts with a shebang (#!). 
The shebang is used in scripts to signify an interpreter for execution in the UNIX-like operating system. 
After the shebang comes the absolute path to the Bash interpreter (/bin/bash). 
This makes sure that Bash will be used to interpret the script even when executed under another shell.

Example: 
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello World


Package Management
==================
Packages are a convenient method to deliver software.
Package tool maintains a database of installed applications.
Package management is the systematic means of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software on a computer’s operating system.

Debian Family
-------------
- dpkg: command to install a local .deb package
- apt & apt-get: commands to download and install packages
- .deb: file extension

The 'apt' and 'apt-get' commands are used to automatically download a package from a remote (internet-based) repository.
The 'dpkg' command can be used to install packages locally.


Linux Processes
===============
top: displays real-time processor utilization
htop: displays real-time processor utilization in an easier to read format
ps: displays the current user’s active processes
ps aux: displays an exhaustive list of all processes by all users
kill: ends a running process


Basic Linux Networking Commands
===============================
ping: test connectivity between two nodes (by default, ping will run continuously until manually stopped)

traceroute: displays the Layer 3 hops taken to reach a destination

ifconfig [interface]: displays interface information of all interfaces (or a specific interface)

ip link / ip addr list: list all the interfaces on the local system

ip addr: assign or delete an IP address to a specific interface (not persistent through a system restart)
Example: sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.50/24 dev eth1 

ip route: add a route to the local system (not persistent through a system restart)
Example: sudo ip route add 172.16.10.0/24 via 192.168.200.50 dev eth1

ifup / ifdown: used to enable or disable a specific interface

netstat: display local computer’s connection information, routing table information
netstat -r: displays local routing table (same as the 'route' command)
netstat -i: displays interface statistics

dig: used to display DNS information such as A Records, MX Records, and CNAMES

host: used to resolve a hostname to an IP address or vice versa and learn DNS information such as MX Records, Name Servers, CNAME, etc.

ssh: used to securely log in to remote systems
By default, your Linux username is used as the username to log in to the remote host.
You can pass the username using 'ssh username@device' or use the –l flag to specify the login username.
You can use the -p flag to specify the port number if the system isn’t using the default port of 22.

Example: ssh admin@192.168.1.1 -p 2222 OR ssh –l john 192.168.1.1

ip route list: primary method for viewing and modifying the routing table
route: another command to view and modify the routing table

arp: view local system ARP table or set a static ARP entry
Example: arp -s LOCAL_MACHINE 50:51:52:53:54:55


Persistent Network Configuration
================================
Persistent interface route information is stored in: /etc/network/interfaces

To modify the network configuration file, you need to open it in a text editor.
Example: nano /etc/network/interfaces

Static / DHCP: iface eth0 inet static / iface eth0 inet dhcp

On newer Debian distributions, the file containing interface configuration information is located in /etc/netplan/*.yaml and can be modified with any text editor.
The Netplan configuration file name can differ based on the Linux installation type. 
Common file types include 01-netcfg.yaml, 01-networkmaanger-all.yaml, and 50-cloud-init.yaml.

Example: more /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  ethernets:
    ens192:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [172.21.55.10/24]
     gateway4: 172.21.55.1
     nameservers:
       addresses: [100.65.0.51,100.65.0.52]

After modifying Netplan files, you must use the 'sudo netplan apply' command to apply the configuration.


Red Hat
-------
On Red Hat distributions, the file containing interface configuration information is located in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface-name
Example: cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33

DEVICE=ens33 
BOOTPROTO=none 
ONBOOT=yes 
PREFIX=24 
IPADDR=172.21.1.55 
GATEWAY=172.21.1.1


Updating DNS
------------
DNS information is stored in the resolv.conf file.
The absolute path is /etc/resolv.conf
Dynamically constructed from files located in: /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/

Example: 
nameserver 127.0.1.1 nameserver 10.8.8.8

While it is possible to edit /etc/resolv.conf manually, it is not recommended as your changed will be overridden when networking is restarted or the system reboots. 
To regenerate resolv.conf, you can restart networking ('sudo service networking restart') or use the 'sudo resolvconf -u' command.

After changing an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, adding additional NIC or similar network tasks, you must restart the networking service in order for your change to take effect. 
There are several commands to accomplish it, but the easiest is to use 'sudo systemctl restart networking', which restarts the service for the entire system.
