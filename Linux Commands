Using the Bash (the Bourne Again Shell)
=======================================

touch: to create an empty file
mkdir: make a new directory
mkdir -p: make all required sub-directories in the path
rm: remove a file
rm -r: remove an entire directory and its contents
rmdir: remove an empty directory
rm -rf: remove a directory and contents including write-protected files
cp: copy a file
mv: move or rename a file
sudo: run a command as root user
su: change to the root user


File Permissions
================

Permissions are based on two factors:
- permissions assigned to a specific user and group (owner/user, group, other)
- permissions assigned to a specific action (read, write, execute)

- = file
d = directory
rwx = read, write, execute

Code structure: file/directory (1) - user (3) - group (3) - other (3)

Example: drwxrwxrwx is a directory, where user, group and other have read, write and execute permissions

Example: -rw-rw-r-- is a file, where user and group have read and write permissions, other can only read

chmod: update and change file permissions

chmod [u, g, o] (+/- [r, w, x]) for each action

Example: chmod u+x script.py says that the user of the file should be able to eXecute the script

Every Bash shell script starts with a shebang (#!). 
The shebang is used in scripts to signify an interpreter for execution in the UNIX-like operating system. 
After the shebang comes the absolute path to the Bash interpreter (/bin/bash). 
This makes sure that Bash will be used to interpret the script even when executed under another shell.

Example: 
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello World


Package Management
==================
Packages are a convenient method to deliver software.
Package tool maintains a database of installed applications.
Package management is the systematic means of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software on a computerâ€™s operating system.

Debian Family
-------------
- dpkg: command to install a local .deb package
- apt & apt-get: commands to download and install packages
- .deb: file extension

The 'apt' and 'apt-get' commands are used to automatically download a package from a remote (internet-based) repository.
The 'dpkg' command can be used to install packages locally.
